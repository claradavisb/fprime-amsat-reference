This Git Repo contains the F' reference repository for the AMSAT® CubeSat Simulator.

## F' Framework Overview
F´ (F Prime) is an open-source, component-driven software framework developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for rapid development and deployment of embedded systems and spaceflight applications. It is designed to simplify the creation of flight-quality software, particularly for small-scale missions like CubeSats, SmallSats, instruments, and deployables, but it can be used for any embedded system.

## AMSAT® CubeSat Simulator Overview
The CubeSatSim(TM) is a low cost satellite emulator that runs on solar panels and batteries, transmits UHF radio telemetry, has a 3D printed frame, and can be extended by additional sensors and modules.  This project is sponsored by the not-for-profit [Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation, AMSAT®](https://amsat.org).
